    "Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can add comments to your code to provide explanations or make notes. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are meant for human readers. There are two types of comments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-line comments: To create a single-line comment, use the hash symbol (#) before the comment text. Anything after the hash symbol on the same line will be considered a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This is another comment after a statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-line comments: For multi-line comments, you can use triple quotes (''' or \"\"\") to enclose the comment block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'''\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "It can span across multiple lines.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```"

    "Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in the computer's memory. It allows you to store and manipulate data during the program's execution. Variables can hold different data types like numbers, strings, lists, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare and assign a value to a variable, you simply use the assignment operator (=).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Variable declaration and assignment\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "name = \"John\"\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, three variables are declared and assigned values: `x` is assigned the value 10 (an integer), `name` is assigned the string \"John\", and `is_student` is assigned the boolean value True.\n"

    "Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions. Some common type conversion functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `int()`: Convert to an integer.\n",
    "2. `float()`: Convert to a floating-point number.\n",
    "3. `str()`: Convert to a string.\n",
    "4. `list()`: Convert to a list.\n",
    "5. `tuple()`: Convert to a tuple.\n",
    "6. `bool()`: Convert to a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Converting data types\n",
    "num_str = \"42\"\n",
    "num_int = int(num_str)  # Converts the string \"42\" to the integer 42\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Open a text editor (like Notepad, VSCode, or any other code editor).\n",

    "3. Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).\n",
    "4. Navigate to the directory where your Python script is saved using the `cd` command (change directory).\n",
    "5. To execute the script, type `python script.py` (replace `script.py` with the name of your Python file) and press Enter.\n",

    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a complex number is a number that comprises two parts: a real part and an imaginary part. It is represented in the form `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part, `b` is the imaginary part, and `j` is the imaginary unit (i.e., the square root of -1).\n",
